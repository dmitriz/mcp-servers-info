#### 2. Content Modularization  
**Action**: Extract shared content into reusable modules
- Create `/research/modules/` directory
- Extract server classifications, complexity tiers, metrics
- Replace duplicated content with reference links
**Expected Impact**: Single source of truth for common elements

#### 3. README Restructuring
**Action**: Eliminate duplicate navigation sections
- Consolidate Strategic Implementation Frameworks sections
- Remove redundant framework listings
- Create clear, non-overlapping content hierarchy
**Expected Impact**: Improved user experience and reduced confusion

### Medium-Priority Actions (Next Phase):

#### 4. Implement Documentation Best Practices
**Based on Perplexity research findings**:
