#### File Search Tool  
**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Good)**
- ✅ Accurately identified framework document patterns
- ✅ Efficient glob pattern matching for related files
- ✅ Quick identification of file naming conventions
- ⚠️ Limited to filename patterns, not content analysis

#### Grep Search Tool
**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Good)**
- ✅ Excellent for finding specific repeated phrases
- ✅ Regex pattern matching worked effectively
- ✅ Quantified redundancy with match counts (43 results)
- ⚠️ Required multiple queries for comprehensive analysis

#### Read File Tool
**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good)**
- ✅ Essential for detailed content verification
- ✅ Precise line-by-line content analysis
- ⚠️ Time-intensive for large-scale redundancy analysis
- ⚠️ Required many sequential calls for comprehensive coverage

#### Run Terminal Tool
**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐ (Limited)**
- ⚠️ Windows compatibility issues with Unix commands
- ⚠️ File size analysis interrupted by signal termination
- ✅ Could provide quantitative metrics when working properly
- 💡 Better suited for file system operations than content analysis

### Tool Synergy Analysis

**Best Tool Combinations for Redundancy Analysis:**
1. **Semantic Search + Grep Search**: Excellent for content pattern identification
2. **File Search + Read File**: Effective for structural analysis verification
3. **Semantic Search + Read File**: Optimal for detailed content comparison

**Recommended MCP Research Workflow:**
```
Phase 1: Semantic Search → Identify content themes and patterns
Phase 2: File Search → Map related document structures  
Phase 3: Grep Search → Quantify specific redundancy patterns
Phase 4: Read File → Verify and detail redundant content blocks
Phase 5: Analysis → Document findings and recommendations
```
