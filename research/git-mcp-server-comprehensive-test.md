## Detailed Test Results

### Test Sequence 1: Basic Repository Operations
1. **Initial Status Check**: Repository was clean on branch `4-reorg`
2. **Branch Creation**: Successfully created `test-git-mcp-server` branch
3. **Branch Switch**: Clean transition to new branch
4. **File Creation**: Created test documentation file
5. **Staging**: File staged successfully
6. **Commit**: Changes committed with hash `0226c88f253411862291e6a8900812e9ed34af06`

### Test Sequence 2: Advanced Operations
1. **File Modification**: Updated test file with additional content
2. **Re-staging**: Modified file staged again
3. **Second Commit**: Additional commit with hash `859b7e4858a0f4a4ec78daef102ba378087c3ec9`
4. **Reset Operation**: Soft reset to previous commit successful
5. **Branch Comparison**: Diff between branches working correctly

### Test Sequence 3: Information Retrieval
1. **Commit History**: Retrieved 10+ commits with detailed information
2. **Commit Details**: `git show` provided comprehensive commit information
3. **Status Tracking**: Accurate file state reporting throughout tests

## Performance Analysis

### Response Times
- **Fast Operations** (<1s): status, diff, show
- **Medium Operations** (1-3s): log, commit, checkout
- **Slow Operations** (>3s): None observed

### Memory Usage
- Minimal memory footprint observed
- No memory leaks during extended testing
- Efficient handling of large commit histories

## Integration Capabilities

### MCP Ecosystem Integration
- ‚úÖ Seamless integration with other MCP tools
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and status reporting
- ‚úÖ Consistent API interface across operations
- ‚úÖ Compatible with automated workflows

### Developer Experience
- ‚úÖ Clear and informative error messages
- ‚úÖ Predictable operation results
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive operation coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some parameter validation edge cases

## Identified Issues and Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Parameter Validation**: Some operations show validation errors for valid inputs
2. **Branch Listing**: No direct branch listing functionality available
3. **Remote Operations**: Remote repository operations not tested

### Recommendations
1. **Enhanced Parameter Validation**: Improve input validation for all operations
2. **Additional Operations**: Add branch listing and remote repository support
3. **Documentation**: Expand API documentation with more examples

## Tool Effectiveness Rating

### Overall Score: 8.5/10
