# MCP Research Best Practices

*Simple guide for effective research using MCP tools*

## 🎯 Core Research Principles

### **1. Parallel Tool Usage**
- Use multiple tools simultaneously for the same query
- Compare results across tools for accuracy verification  
- Different tools excel at different aspects of research

### **2. Tool Selection Strategy**
- **Start broad** → **Narrow down** → **Synthesize**
- Use effectiveness tiers to prioritize tools
- Match tool strengths to research phase

### **3. Quality Assurance**
- Always verify sources when provided
- Cross-reference important findings
- Document your research process

## 🔬 Research Workflow Templates

### **Template 1: Literature Review**
```
1. Perplexity → Comprehensive overview with citations
2. Context7 → Technical specifications and documentation
3. Sequential Thinking → Organize and structure findings
4. Memory → Store key insights for future reference
```

### **Template 2: Market/Ecosystem Analysis**  
```
1. Brave Search → Current landscape and recent developments
2. Tavily → Deep technical analysis of key topics
3. Perplexity → Synthesis and trend analysis
4. Memory → Store competitive intelligence
```

### **Template 3: Technical Implementation Research**
```
1. Context7 → Official documentation and examples
2. GitHub → Real-world implementation patterns
3. Sequential Thinking → Implementation planning
4. Memory → Store implementation decisions
```

### **Template 4: Exploratory Research**
```
1. Multiple tools in parallel → Broad information gathering
2. Sequential Thinking → Identify patterns and gaps
3. Focused follow-up → Deep dive on interesting findings
4. Memory → Build knowledge base over time
