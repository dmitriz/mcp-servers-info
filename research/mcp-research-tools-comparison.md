## Research Efficiency Recommendations

1. **Parallel Research Strategy**:
   - Start with Brave Search to discover key resources
   - Use Perplexity for in-depth analysis of concepts
   - Use Fetch for directly accessing known documentation

2. **Time-Optimized Approach**:
   - For quick answers: Brave Search → Perplexity
   - For deep research: Perplexity → Fetch specific URLs
   - For implementation: Fetch SDK examples → Brave Search for tutorials

3. **Task Optimization**:
   - Batch similar queries
   - Use focused search terms
   - Extract key information only
   - Summarize findings immediately

## Future Tasks (For Later Implementation)

- Create MCP server template repository using TypeScript SDK
- Develop benchmark suite for comparing MCP server performance

- Build integration examples with popular frameworks

## Key MCP Implementation Insights

From our research, we found that MCP servers:

1. Follow a client-server architecture for standardized AI model integrations
2. Can be implemented with minimal code using the TypeScript SDK
3. Support both static and dynamic resources for data retrieval
4. Provide tools functionality for executing actions
5. Can use various transports (stdio, HTTP streaming) depending on use case

*This analysis prioritized efficiency and focused on extracting the most valuable insights without lengthy operations.*
