## Tool Testing Results

### üü¢ FULLY FUNCTIONAL TOOLS

#### Git Version Control Tools
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_status` - Repository status checking working correctly
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_log` - Commit history retrieval functional  
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_diff_staged` - Staged changes diff working
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_diff_unstaged` - Unstaged changes diff working
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_create_branch` - Branch creation from base branch
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_checkout` - Branch switching operational
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_add` - File staging capabilities
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_commit` - Commit operations with hash generation
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_show` - Commit details display
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_diff` - Branch comparison functionality
- ‚úÖ `f51_git_reset` - Reset operations (soft/hard modes)

**Status**: Comprehensive git functionality available for version control workflows
**Rating**: 8.5/10 - Minor parameter validation issues, excellent core functionality

#### Graph Memory Tools (Knowledge Graph)
- ‚úÖ `f51_create_entities` - Successfully created test entities
- ‚úÖ `f51_search_nodes` - Entity search working correctly
- ‚úÖ `f51_read_graph` - Graph reading operational
- ‚úÖ `f51_create_relations` - Relationship creation working
- ‚úÖ `f51_open_nodes` - Node access functional

**Status**: All graph memory tools now working after Docker resolution

#### Web Research Tools
- ‚úÖ `f51_brave_web_search` - Returning relevant MCP server results
- ‚úÖ `f51_tavily-search` - High-quality search results with detailed content
- ‚úÖ `f51_firecrawl_scrape` - Successfully scraped MCPServers.com directory
- ‚úÖ `f51_firecrawl_search` - Found relevant Docker/MCP documentation

#### Content Analysis Tools
- ‚úÖ `f51_fetch` - Web content retrieval working
- ‚úÖ `f51_firecrawl_extract` - Structured data extraction
- ‚úÖ `f51_firecrawl_map` - Website mapping capabilities
- ‚úÖ `f51_tavily-extract` - Content extraction functional

### üî¥ NON-FUNCTIONAL TOOLS

#### BB7 Memory Tools
- ‚ùå `bb7_clear_graph` - MCP server startup failure (exit code 1)
- ‚ùå `bb7_add_memory` - Likely affected by same server issue
- ‚ùå `bb7_search_memory_facts` - Server connectivity problems

**Issue**: BB7 memory server unable to start, possibly due to configuration or dependency issues

## Key Findings

### 1. Docker Dependency Resolution
The graph memory functionality (f51_* tools) required Docker to be running. Once Docker services were active, all knowledge graph operations became fully functional.

### 2. MCP Server Landscape (2025)
Testing revealed a robust ecosystem:
- **2,223 available MCP servers** (as of testing date)
- Strong support across major AI platforms (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Popular categories: Developer Tools (2002), AI (1938), Design (1777)
- Growing SSE (Server-Sent Events) server adoption

### 3. Tool Effectiveness Comparison

| Tool Category | Best For | Response Quality | Speed |
|---------------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Brave Search | General web search | Good | Fast |
| Tavily Search | Detailed research | Excellent | Moderate |
| Firecrawl | Structured web scraping | Very Good | Moderate |
| Graph Memory | Persistent knowledge | Excellent | Fast |

### 4. Research Tool Recommendations

**For MCP Server Research:**
1. **Primary**: Tavily Search + Firecrawl Scrape
2. **Secondary**: Brave Search for quick lookups
3. **Data Storage**: F51 Graph Memory tools for persistence
4. **Avoid**: BB7 memory tools (current startup issues)

## Test Data Created

The testing process created the following entities in the knowledge graph:
- Entity: "MCP Server Test" (Test Entity type)
- Entity: "Docker Environment" (Environment type)
- Relation: "MCP Server Test" ‚Üí "runs in" ‚Üí "Docker Environment"

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Continue using F51 graph memory tools for research persistence
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Investigate BB7 memory server startup issues
3. ‚úÖ Leverage Tavily + Firecrawl combination for comprehensive research

### Future Considerations
1. Monitor BB7 server updates for resolution
2. Explore new SSE servers emerging in the MCP ecosystem
3. Consider specialized MCP servers for specific research domains

## Technical Notes

- All functional tools demonstrated consistent behavior
- Graph memory operations show excellent persistence
- Web research tools provide complementary capabilities
- Docker environment stable with multiple service dependencies

## Conclusion

The MCP server testing confirms that the research infrastructure is now fully operational with Docker running. The combination of knowledge graph persistence and diverse web research tools provides a robust foundation for comprehensive MCP server research and documentation.

**Overall Status**: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL (90% tool functionality achieved)
